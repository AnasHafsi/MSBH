# GitHub Actions Workflow Improvements

## Overview

Two important GitHub Actions workflow improvements were created but could not be automatically pushed due to workflow permissions. These files are available locally and should be manually committed when you have the appropriate repository permissions.

## Files Created

### 1. `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (NEW)

**Purpose**: Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for code quality and build verification

**Features**:
- Runs on push and pull requests to main/master/develop branches
- **Lint Job**: Runs ESLint to check code quality
- **Format Job**: Checks code formatting with Prettier
- **Build Job**: Verifies the Gatsby build succeeds
- Uses Node.js 22 with npm caching for faster builds
- Proper job dependencies (build runs after lint passes)

**Benefits**:
- Catches code quality issues before merge
- Ensures builds don't break
- Automated checks on every PR
- Faster feedback loop for developers

### 2. `.github/workflows/opencommit.yml` (MODIFIED)

**Purpose**: Security improvement to fix overly permissive GitHub Actions permissions

**Changes Made**:
```yaml
# BEFORE (Security Risk)
permissions: write-all

# AFTER (Secure)
permissions:
  contents: write
  pull-requests: write
```

**Benefits**:
- Follows principle of least privilege
- Reduces attack surface
- More secure according to GitHub security best practices
- Only grants the specific permissions needed

## Why They Couldn't Be Pushed

GitHub Apps (including Claude Code) require explicit `workflows` permission to create or modify workflow files. This is a security feature to prevent unauthorized automation from modifying CI/CD pipelines.

## How to Manually Add These Files

### Option 1: Commit Directly (Recommended)

If you have push access to the repository:

```bash
# The files are already in your working directory
git add .github/workflows/ci.yml
git add .github/workflows/opencommit.yml
git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline and fix workflow permissions

- Add comprehensive CI pipeline with linting, formatting, and build checks
- Fix security issue: change opencommit permissions from write-all to specific
"
git push
```

### Option 2: Create a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b add-workflow-improvements
   ```

2. Commit the workflow files:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/ci.yml .github/workflows/opencommit.yml
   git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline and fix workflow permissions"
   git push -u origin add-workflow-improvements
   ```

3. Create a PR on GitHub and merge it

### Option 3: Use GitHub Web Interface

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Navigate to `.github/workflows/`
3. Create new file `ci.yml` and copy contents from local file
4. Edit `opencommit.yml` and update the permissions section
5. Commit directly or create a PR

## Verification

After adding these files, you can verify they work by:

1. **CI Pipeline**: Make a small change and create a PR - you should see the CI checks run
2. **OpenCommit**: Check the workflow runs - it should now have restricted permissions

## File Locations

The files are located at:
- `/home/user/MSBH/.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- `/home/user/MSBH/.github/workflows/opencommit.yml`

You can view them with:
```bash
cat .github/workflows/ci.yml
cat .github/workflows/opencommit.yml
```

## Impact

- **Security**: HIGH - Fixes a security vulnerability in GitHub Actions permissions
- **Code Quality**: HIGH - Adds automated linting and formatting checks
- **Build Reliability**: MEDIUM - Catches build failures before merge
- **Developer Experience**: MEDIUM - Faster feedback on code quality
